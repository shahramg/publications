    - Abstract:  This paper presents techniques to display 3D illuminations using Flying Light Specks, FLSs. Each FLS is a miniature (hundreds of micrometers) sized drone with one or more light sources to generate different colors and textures with adjustable brightness. It is network enabled with a processor and local storage. Synchronized swarms of cooperating FLSs render illumination of virtual objects in a pre-specified 3D volume, an FLS display. We present techniques to display both static and motion illuminations. Our display techniques consider the limited flight time of an FLS on a fully charged battery and the duration of time to charge the FLS battery. Moreover, our techniques assume failure of FLSs is the norm rather than an exception. We present a hardware and a software architecture for an FLS-display along with a family of techniques to compute flight paths of FLSs for illuminations. With motion illuminations, one technique (ICF) minimizes the overall distance traveled by the FLSs significantly when compared with the other techniques.

USC [FLS Laboratory](https://www.flslab.org/) Technical Report Number 2022-01.  This paper appeared in CHI 2022 Workshop on Novel Challenges of Safety, Security and Privacy in Extended Reality, April 25, 2022.
    - Abstract:  Technological advances in holography, robotics, and 3D printing are starting to realize the vision of a holodeck. These immersive 3D displays must address user safety from the start to be viable. A holodeck's safety challenges are novel because its applications will involve explicit physical interactions between humans and synthesized 3D objects and experiences in real-time. This pioneering paper first proposes research directions for modeling safety in future holodeck applications from traditional physical human-robot interaction modeling. Subsequently, we propose a test-bed to enable safety validation of physical human-robot interaction based on existing augmented reality and virtual simulation technology.

    - Abstract:  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have moved beyond a platform for hobbyists to enable environmental monitoring, journalism, film industry, search and rescue, package delivery, and entertainment. This paper describes 3D displays using swarms of flying light specks, FLSs. An FLS is a small (hundreds of micrometers in size) UAV with one or more light sources to generate different colors and textures with adjustable brightness. A synchronized swarm of FLSs renders an illumination in a pre-specified 3D volume, an FLS display. An FLS display provides true depth, enabling a user to perceive a scene more completely by analyzing its illumination from different angles. An FLS display may either be non-immersive or immersive. Both will support 3D acoustics. Non-immersive FLS displays may be the size of a 1980's computer monitor, enabling a surgical team to observe and control micro robots performing heart surgery inside a patient's body. Immersive FLS displays may be the size of a room, enabling users to interact with objects, e.g., a rock, a teapot. An object with behavior will be constructed using FLS-matters. FLS-matter will enable a user to touch and manipulate an object, e.g., a user may pick up a teapot or throw a rock. An immersive and interactive FLS display will approximate Star Trek's Holodeck. A successful realization of the research ideas presented in this paper will provide fundamental insights into implementing a Holodeck using swarms of FLSs. A Holodeck will transform the future of human communication and perception, and how we interact with information and data. It will revolutionize the future of how we work, learn, play and entertain, receive medical care, and socialize.

   - Abstract:   The cloud infrastructure motivates disaggregation of monolithic data stores into components that are assembled together based on an application's workload. This study investigates disaggregation of an LSM-tree key-value store into components that communicate using RDMA. These components separate storage from processing, enabling processing components to share storage bandwidth and space. The processing components scatter blocks of a file (SSTable) across an arbitrary number of storage components and balance load across them using power-of-d. They construct ranges dynamically at runtime to parallelize compaction and enhance performance. Each component has configuration knobs that control its scalability. The resulting component-based system, Nova-LSM, is elastic. It outperforms its monolithic counterparts, both LevelDB and RocksDB, by several orders of magnitude with workloads that exhibit a skewed pattern of access to data.

   - Abstract:   The cloud challenges many fundamental assumptions of today’s monolithic data stores. It offers a diverse choice of servers with alternative forms of processing capability, storage, memory sizes, and networking hardware. It also offers fast network between servers and racks such as RDMA. This motivates a component-based architecture that separates storage from processing for a data store. This architecture complements the classical shared-nothing architecture by allowing nodes to share each other’s disk bandwidth and storage. This architecture is also flexible to configure its components to handle both write-heavy workloads and read-heavy workloads. This emerging component-based software architecture constitutes the focus of this dissertation.  We present design, implementation, and evaluation of Nova-LSM as a component-based design of LSM-tree using RDMA for write-heavy workloads. First, they use RDMA to enable nodes of a shared-nothing architecture to share their disk bandwidth and storage.  Second, they construct ranges dynamically at runtime to parallelize compaction and boost performance. Third, they scatter blocks of a file (SSTable) across an arbitrary number of disks and use power-of-d to scale.  Fourth, the logging component separates availability of log records from their durability.  These design decisions provide for an elastic system with well-defined knobs that control its performance and scalability characteristics.  We present an implementation of these designs by extending LevelDB.  Our evaluation shows Nova-LSM scales and outperforms its monolithic counter-parts, both LevelDB and RocksDB, by several orders of magnitude.  This is especially true with workloads that exhibit a skewed pattern of access to data. We also present design, implementation, and evaluation of Gemini as a component-based design of persistent cache for read-heavy workloads. Gemini recovers cache entries intact in the presence of failures while preserving strong consistency. It also transfers the working set of the application to maximize cache hit ratio. Our evaluation shows that Gemini restores hit ratio two orders of magnitude faster than a volatile cache. Working set transfer is particularly effective with workloads that exhibit an evolving access pattern.

   - Abstract:  With a multi-node data store, a skewed pattern of access to data results in formation of hot spots and bottleneck servers.  In its most extreme, one server out of many may dictate the overall processing capability of the system, reducing the throughput of a thousand node system to that of one node.  This paper presents alternative bottlenecks due to a skewed pattern of data access and a taxonomy of solutions to resolve them.  We identify use of the emerging RDMA as an opportunity to design and implement novel load balancing algorithms.

   - Abstract:  An enumeration of RDMA messaging verbs READ, WRITE, SEND/RECEIVE and queue pair types creates a diverse set of message passing protocols.  This paper constructs three abstract communication paradigms to quantify the performance and scalability characteristics of five protocols.  With each abstraction, different protocols provide different results and the identity of the protocol that is superior to the others changes.  Factors such as the number of queue pairs per node, the size of messages, the number of pending requests per queue pair, and the abstract communication paradigm dictate the superiority of a protocol.  These results are important for design and implementation of algorithms and techniques that use the emerging RDMA.

USC Database Laboratory Technical Report Number 2019-01.  In the 15th IEEE International Conference on Beyond Database Architectures and Structures (BDAS), Ustron, Poland, May 28-31, 2019.
    - Abstract:  Nova proposes a departure from today's complex monolithic database management systems (DBMSs) as a service using the cloud.  It advocates a server-less alternative consisting of a cloud of simple components that communicate using high speed networks.   Nova will monitor the workload of an application continuously, configuring the DBMS to use the appropriate implementation of a component most suitable for processing the workload.  In response to load fluctuations, it will adjust the knobs of a component to scale it to meet the performance requirements of the application.  The vision of Nova is compelling because it adjusts resource usage, preventing either over-provisioning of resources that sit idle or over-utilized resources that yield a low performance, optimizing total cost of ownership.  In addition to introducing Nova, this vision paper presents key research challenges that must be addressed to realize Nova.  We explore two challenges in detail.

In the Second IEEE International Workshop on Benchmarking, Performance Tuning and Optimization for Big Data Applications, Seattle, WA, December 10, 2018.
    - Abstract:  Hoagie   is   a   plug-n-play   workload   and   database generator to evaluate novel system architectures, design decisions, protocols, and algorithms. It uses published specifications to create a database of data items and a workload that references these data  items.  Hoagie<92>s  modular  design  enables  an  experimentalist to use it either offline or online. In offline mode, Hoagie outputs a trace file that can be used to issue requests to a target system.  In  online  mode,  Hoagie  is  plugged  into  an  existing  benchmark that  invokes  it  to  generate  requests  one  at  a  time  to  its  target system.  We  have  made  Hoagie  open  source  to  foster  its  future development.

5. Hieu Nguyen.  [Asynchronous Writes in Cache Augmented Data Stores](./asynchronous.pdf).  USC Database Laboratory Technical Report Number 2018-09.  A chapter appeared in VLDB 2019, Los Angeles, California.
    - Abstract:  This dissertation explores processing of writes asynchronously in a cache augmented data store while maintaining the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) properties of transactions. It enables the caching layer to dictate the overall system performance with both read-heavy and write-heavy workloads, motivating alternative implementations of a write-back policy.  A write-back policy buffers writes in the cache and uses background threads to apply them to a data store asynchronously.  By doing so, it enhances the overall system performance and enables the application throughput to scale linearly as a function of the number of cache servers.  The main limitations of this technique are its increased software complexity and additional memory requirement.  When the data store is unavailable, a write-back policy buffers writes as long as the caching layer is available. Once the data store becomes available, it applies the buffered writes to the data store asynchronously. We use this idea to introduce TARDIS, a family of techniques to process writes when the data store is unavailable. TARDIS techniques (TAR, TARD, DIS and TARDIS) differ in how they apply buffered writes to the data store during the recovery mode. While TAR and DIS are simple to implement, other techniques are more complex.  TARDIS is most complex and resembles the write-back policy.  We quantify the tradeoffs associated with the write-back policy and TARDIS family of techniques using YCSB, BG and TPC-C benchmarks. We compare their performance with alternatives such as write-around and write-through policies that perform writes synchronously.  All benchmark results show that asynchronous writes enhance the overall performance and enable the application to scale as a function of the number of nodes in the caching layer.  The results also highlight the extra memory required by the proposed techniques to buffer the writes.

    - Abstract:  This thesis describes the functioning of Polygraph, a new plug-and-play tool created by the author for quantifying application anomalies attributed to system behavior that violates atomicity, isolation, linearizability properties of transactions.  Example anomalies include erroneous results due to a software bug or an incorrect implementation, dirty reads when a database management system is configured with a weak consistency setting, and stale data produced by a cache. Polygraph is application-agnostic and scales to detect anomalies and compute freshness confidence in real time. It consists of authoring, monitoring, and validation components.  An experimentalist uses the Polygraph authoring tool to generate code snippets to embed in application software. These code snippets generate log records capturing conceptual application transactions at the granularity of entities and their relationships. Polygraph validates application transactions in a scalable manner by dividing the task into sub-tasks that process fragments of log records concurrently. Polygraph<92>s monitoring tool visualizes transactions to help reason about anomalies. Polygraph is extensible, enabling a developer to tailor one or more of its components to be application-specific. For example, this thesis describes an extension of Polygraph<92>s validation component to validate range predicates and simple analytics, such as max and min. The thesis also demonstrates the use of Polygraph with a variety of benchmarks representing diverse applications including TPC-C, BG, YCSB, SEATS and TATP.

7. Shahram Ghandeharizadeh and Hieu Nguyen. [Design, Implementation, and Evaluation of Write-Back Policy with Cache Augmented Data Stores] (./writeback.pdf).  USC Database Laboratory Technical Report Number 2018-07.  A shorter version appeared in VLDB 2019, Los Angeles, California.
    - Abstract:  The Cache Augmented Data Store (CADS) architecture extends a persistent data store with an in-memory cache manager.  It is widely deployed to support read-intensive workloads.  However, its write-around and write-through policies prevent the caching tier from absorbing write load.  This means the data store layer must scale to process writes even when the extra capacity is not needed for read load.  We address this limitation by devising a write-back technique to enable the caching layer to process both reads and writes.  This technique preserves ACID transactions.  We present a client side implementation of write-back and evaluate it using the YCSB, BG, and TPC-C benchmarks.  Obtained results show the write-back policy enables the caching layer to process writes and scale horizontally.  With some workloads, it out-performs write-around and write-through by more than 50x.  In addition, we compare our write-back with (a) write-back policy of a data store such as MongoDB and (b) write-back policy of a host-side cache such as Flashcache.  Our proposed write-back complements these alternatives, enhancing their performance more than 2x.
