   - Abstract:  With a multi-node data store, a skewed pattern of access to data results in formation of hot spots and bottleneck servers.  In its most extreme, one server out of many may dictate the overall processing capability of the system, reducing the throughput of a thousand node system to that of one node.  This paper presents alternative bottlenecks due to a skewed pattern of data access and a taxonomy of solutions to resolve them.  We identify use of the emerging RDMA as an opportunity to design and implement novel load balancing algorithms.
