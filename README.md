    - Abstract:  This paper presents techniques to display 3D illuminations using Flying Light Specks, FLSs. Each FLS is a miniature (hundreds of micrometers) sized drone with one or more light sources to generate different colors and textures with adjustable brightness. It is network enabled with a processor and local storage. Synchronized swarms of cooperating FLSs render illumination of virtual objects in a pre-specified 3D volume, an FLS display. We present techniques to display both static and motion illuminations. Our display techniques consider the limited flight time of an FLS on a fully charged battery and the duration of time to charge the FLS battery. Moreover, our techniques assume failure of FLSs is the norm rather than an exception. We present a hardware and a software architecture for an FLS-display along with a family of techniques to compute flight paths of FLSs for illuminations. With motion illuminations, one technique (ICF) minimizes the overall distance traveled by the FLSs significantly when compared with the other techniques.

   - Abstract:  With a multi-node data store, a skewed pattern of access to data results in formation of hot spots and bottleneck servers.  In its most extreme, one server out of many may dictate the overall processing capability of the system, reducing the throughput of a thousand node system to that of one node.  This paper presents alternative bottlenecks due to a skewed pattern of data access and a taxonomy of solutions to resolve them.  We identify use of the emerging RDMA as an opportunity to design and implement novel load balancing algorithms.

   - Abstract:  An enumeration of RDMA messaging verbs READ, WRITE, SEND/RECEIVE and queue pair types creates a diverse set of message passing protocols.  This paper constructs three abstract communication paradigms to quantify the performance and scalability characteristics of five protocols.  With each abstraction, different protocols provide different results and the identity of the protocol that is superior to the others changes.  Factors such as the number of queue pairs per node, the size of messages, the number of pending requests per queue pair, and the abstract communication paradigm dictate the superiority of a protocol.  These results are important for design and implementation of algorithms and techniques that use the emerging RDMA.

USC Database Laboratory Technical Report Number 2019-01.  In the 15th IEEE International Conference on Beyond Database Architectures and Structures (BDAS), Ustron, Poland, May 28-31, 2019.
    - Abstract:  Nova proposes a departure from today's complex monolithic database management systems (DBMSs) as a service using the cloud.  It advocates a server-less alternative consisting of a cloud of simple components that communicate using high speed networks.   Nova will monitor the workload of an application continuously, configuring the DBMS to use the appropriate implementation of a component most suitable for processing the workload.  In response to load fluctuations, it will adjust the knobs of a component to scale it to meet the performance requirements of the application.  The vision of Nova is compelling because it adjusts resource usage, preventing either over-provisioning of resources that sit idle or over-utilized resources that yield a low performance, optimizing total cost of ownership.  In addition to introducing Nova, this vision paper presents key research challenges that must be addressed to realize Nova.  We explore two challenges in detail.

In the Second IEEE International Workshop on Benchmarking, Performance Tuning and Optimization for Big Data Applications, Seattle, WA, December 10, 2018.
    - Abstract:  Hoagie   is   a   plug-n-play   workload   and   database generator to evaluate novel system architectures, design decisions, protocols, and algorithms. It uses published specifications to create a database of data items and a workload that references these data  items.  Hoagie<92>s  modular  design  enables  an  experimentalist to use it either offline or online. In offline mode, Hoagie outputs a trace file that can be used to issue requests to a target system.  In  online  mode,  Hoagie  is  plugged  into  an  existing  benchmark that  invokes  it  to  generate  requests  one  at  a  time  to  its  target system.  We  have  made  Hoagie  open  source  to  foster  its  future development.
