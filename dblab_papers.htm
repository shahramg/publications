  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>During the past decade, parallel database systems have gained increased 
  popularity due to their high performance, scalability and availability 
  characteristics. With the predicted future database sizes and the complexity 
  of queries, the scalability of these systems to hundreds and thousands of 
  processors is essential for satisfying the projected demand. Several studies 
  have repeatedly demonstrated that both the performance and scalability of a 
  parallel database system is contingent on the physical layout of data across 
  the processors of the system. If the data is not declustered properly, the 
  execution of an operator might waste resources, reducing the overall 
  processing capability of the system. With earlier, single attribute 
  declustering strategies, such as those found in Tandem, Teradata, Gamma, and 
  Bubba parallel database systems, a selection query including a range predicate 
  on any attribute other than the partitioning attribute must be sent to all 
  processors containing tuples of the relation. By directing a query with 
  minimal resource requirements to processors that contain no relevant tuples, 
  the system wastes CPU cycles, communication bandwidth, and I/O bandwidth, 
  reducing its overall processing capability. As a solution, several 
  multi-attribute declustering strategies have been proposed. However, the 
  performance of these declustering techniques have not previously been compared 
  to one another nor with a single attribute partitioning strategy. This paper, 
  compares the performance of Multi-Attribute GrId deClustering ({\em MAGIC}) 
  and Bubba's Extended Range Declustering ({\em BERD}) strategies with one 
  another and with the range partitioning strategy. Our results indicate that 
  MAGIC outperforms both range and BERD in all experiments conducted in this 
  study.

  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>Mitra is a scalable storage manager that supports the display of 
  continuous media data types, e.g., audio and video clips. It is a software 
  based system that employs off-the-shelf hardware components. Its present 
  hardware platform is a cluster of multi-disk workstations, connected using an 
  ATM switch. Mitra supports the display of a mix of media types. To reduce the 
  cost of storage, it supports a hierarchical organization of storage devices 
  and stages the frequently accessed objects on the magnetic disks. For the 
  number of displays to scale as a function of additional disks, Mitra employs 
  staggered striping. It implements three strategies to maximize the number of 
  simultaneous displays supported by each disk. First, the EVEREST file system 
  allows different files (corresponding to objects of different media types) to 
  be retrieved at different block size granularities. Second, the FIXB algorithm 
  recognizes the different zones of a disk and guarantees a continuous display 
  while harnessing the average disk transfer rate. Third, Mitra implements the 
  Grouped Sweeping Scheme (GSS) to minimize the impact of disk seeks on the 
  available disk bandwidth. 
  <P>In addition to reporting on implementation details of Mitra, we present 
  performance results that demonstrate the scalability characteristics of the 
  system. We compare the obtained results with theoretical expectations based on 
  the bandwidth of participating disks. Mitra attains between 65% to 100% of the 
  theoretical expectations.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>In a scalable server that supports the retrieval and display of continuous 
  media (audio and video clips), both the number of simultaneous displays and 
  the expected startup latency of a display increases as a function of 
  additional disk bandwidth. This paper describes object replication and request 
  migration as two alternative techniques to minimize startup latency. In 
  addition to developing analytical models for these two techniques, we report 
  on their implementation using a scalable server. The results obtained from 
  both the analytical models and the experimental system demonstrate the 
  effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: Book Chapter in Multimedia Information Storage and Management, 
  1996. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>For applications with large data sets, e.g., video servers, magnetic disks 
  have established themselves as the mass storage device of choice. A technique 
  to increase the storage capacity of disks is zoning. A side-effect of zoning 
  is that it introduces a disk drive with variable transfer rates. This chapter 
  describes techniques to support a continuous display of constant-bit rate 
  video and audio objects using a multi-zone disk drive. As compared to previous 
  approaches, the proposed techniques harness the average transfer rate of each 
  magnetic disk (instead of its minimum transfer rate). In addition, we describe 
  a configuration planner that logically manipulates the zoning information of a 
  disk drive to support the performance criteria of an application. We present 
  performance numbers from an experimental prototype to demonstrate the 
  feasibility of our approach.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: In <EM>Proceedings of the ACM SIGMETRICS/PERFORMANCE</EM>, May 
  1995. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of repositories that store 
  and retrieve continuous media data types, e.g., audio and video objects. These 
  repositories are expected to play a major role in several emerging 
  applications, e.g., library information systems, educational applications, 
  entertainment industry, etc. To support the display of a video object, the 
  system partitions each object into fixed size blocks. All blocks of an object 
  reside permanently on the disk drive. When displaying an object, the system 
  stages the blocks of the object into memory one at a time for immediate 
  display. In the presence of multiple displays referencing different objects, 
  the bandwidth of the disk drive is multiplexed among requests, introducing 
  disk seeks. Disk seeks reduce the useful utilization of the disk bandwidth and 
  result in a lower number of simultaneous displays (throughput). 
  <P>This paper characterizes the impact of disk seeks on the throughput of the 
  system. It describes REBECA as a mechanism that maximizes the throughput of 
  the system by minimizing the time attributed to each incurred seek. A 
  limitation of REBECA is that it increases the latency observed by each 
  request. We quantify this throughput vs latency tradeoff of REBECA and, 
  develop an efficient technique that computes its configuration parameters to 
  realize the performance requirements (desired latency and throughput) of an 
  application.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>A challenging task when designing a continuous media server is to support 
  the performance criteria of its target application, i.e., both its desired 
  number of simultaneous displays and the waiting tolerance of its clients. With 
  parallel continuous media servers, the placement of data has a significant 
  impact on the overall performance of the system. Two alternative organizations 
  of data have been described in the literature: Striping and Declustering. In 
  this study, we propose a new framework for placement of data, termed {\em 
  unified}. Unified subsumes both striping and declustering. In addition, it 
  supports hybrid organizations that are a combination of these two techniques. 
  We describe a configuration planner for unified that determines the system 
  parameters such that: 1) it supports the performance criterion of an 
  application, and 2) it minimizes the cost of a system. The experimental 
  results demonstrate both the superiority and flexibility of unified.

  <DT>Abstract:

  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS, vol. 18, issue 3, (MAR, 1995) : pp.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>An emerging area of database system research is to provide support for 
  continuous media data types (digital audio and video). These data types are 
  expected to play a major role in applications such as library information 
  systems, scientific databases, entertainment technology, etc. They require 
  both a high volume of storage and a high bandwidth requirement for their 
  continuous display. The storage organization of systems that support these 
  data types is expected to be hierarchical, consisting of one or more tertiary 
  storage devices, several disk drives, and some memory. The database resides 
  permanently on the tertiary storage device. The disk drives store a number of 
  frequently accessed objects, while the memory is used to stage a small 
  fraction of a referenced object for immediate display. When a user references 
  an object that is tertiary resident, if the system elects to materialize the 
  object on the disk drives in its entirety before initiating its display then 
  the user would observe a high latency time. This paper describes a general 
  purpose pipelining mechanism that overlaps the display of an object with its 
  materialization on the disk drives in order to minimize the latency time of 
  the system. The pipelining mechanism is novel because it ensures a continuous 
  retrieval of an object to a display station (in order to support its 
  continuous display).

  <DD>Storage Systems 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: Proceedings of ACM Multimedia Conference, 1994. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of personal computers at 
  homes, businesses, classrooms, libraries, etc. Most often, these systems are 
  used to disseminate information. Recently, multimedia repositories have added 
  to the excitement of this information age by allowing a user to retrieve and 
  manipulate continuous media data types (audio and video objects). The design 
  and implementation of these systems is challenging due to both the large size 
  of objects that constitute this media type and their continuous bandwidth 
  requirement. Compression in combination with the availability of fast CPUs 
  (for real-time decompression) provide effective support for a continuous 
  display of those objects with a high bandwidth requirement. Hierarchical 
  storage structures (consisting of RAM, disk and tertiary storage devices) 
  provide a cost-effective solution for their large size. The focus of this 
  study is on personal computers (single user, single display) that employ fast 
  CPUs, compression, and hierarchical storage structures to support multimedia 
  applications. Its goals are to ensure a continuous display of audio and video 
  objects while minimizing the latency time observed by the user. Its 
  contributions include a novel pipelining mechanism and PIRATE as a technique 
  to manage the disk resident objects.

  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>An emerging area of database system research is to investigate techniques 
  that ensure a continuous display of video objects. As compared to the 
  traditional data types, e.g., text, a video object must be retrieved at a 
  prespecified rate. If it is retrieved at a lower rate then its display may 
  suffer from frequent disruptions and delays, termed hiccups. This paper 
  describes two alternative approaches to representing video objects 
  (stream-based and structured) and the issues involved in supporting their 
  hiccup-free display. For each approach, we describe the existing solutions and 
  the future research directions from a database systems perspective.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: Proceedings of VLDB Conference, 1995. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>An important requirement for multimedia presentations is the ability to 
  compose new multimedia objects from the existing multimedia objects using 
  temporal relationships. When compositions of continuous media objects are 
  specified on the fly, the task of displaying such composite objects pose new 
  challenges. In this paper, we examine the above problem. We show that in case 
  of a single composite object retrieval, a prefetching technique based on 
  simple sliding provides a new approach to reduce latency and buffering 
  requirements. We extend the prefetching technique based on sliding (buffered 
  sliding) to the problem of retrieving multiple composite objects 
  simultaneously. We consider several variants of the buffered sliding 
  algorithms. Simulation-based study is used to compare their usage pattern of 
  available memory and in determining their relative merits in reducing latency 
  and increasing disk bandwidth utilization.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: 
  <DD>This paper describes a placement technique for the layout of files across 
  the surface of a multi-zone magnetic disk drive to maximize its bandwidth. It 
  argues for a file system that monitors the frequency of access to the files 
  and modifies the placement of files in order to respond to an evolving pattern 
  of file accesses. Such a file system is particularly useful for repositories 
  whose primary functionality is to disseminate information, such as the 
  World-Wide-Web along with thousands of ftp sites that render documents, 
  graphic pictures, images, audio clips, and full-motion video available on the 
  Internet. Employing software techniques to enhance the disk performance is 
  important because its mechanical nature has limited its hardware performance 
  improvements at 7 to 10 percent a year.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: The number of simultaneous displays supported by a continuous 
  media server (e.g, Mitra) depends on the number of disk drives as well as the 
  amount of memory in the system. To support a higher number of displays, one 
  may increase the number of disks in the system and reorganize the placement of 
  data to incorporate their bandwidth. This study presents alternative on-line 
  reorganization techniques that modify the placement of data without disrupting 
  service. We quantify the memory and disk storage requirements of these 
  techniques using analytical models.

  <DT>Title: Scheduling the Retrievals of Continuous Media Objects. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: USC Computer Science Ph.D. Thesis, Aug. 1996. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: In multi-user multimedia information systems (e.g., {\em 
  movie-on-demand}, {\em digital-editing}), scheduling the retrievals of 
  continuous media objects becomes a challenging task. This is due to both 
  $intra$ and $inter$ object time dependencies. Intra-object time dependency 
  refers to the real-time display requirement of a continuous media object. 
  Inter-object time dependency is the temporal relationships defined among 
  multiple continuous media objects. In order to compose tailored multimedia 
  presentations, a user might define complex time dependencies among multiple 
  continuous media objects having various length and display bandwidth 
  requirement. Scheduling the retrieval $tasks$ corresponding to the components 
  of such a presentation in order to respect both inter and intra task time 
  dependencies is the focus of this dissertation. To tackle this problem, we 
  introduce a new class of task scheduling problems and distinguish it from the 
  conventional scheduling problems. The uniqueness of these problems is mostly 
  due to our assumed framework. The framework enables tasks to share resources 
  (disk bandwidth) in a regular manner once activated. Hence, tasks compete with 
  each other over the resources resulting in bandwidth contention. We identify 
  two types of contention depending on the load imposed on the system. Both 
  types of contention might be observed by any member of our class of task 
  scheduling problems. Each scheduling problem is formally defined, and shown to 
  be an intractable problem (NP-hard in strong sense). Subsequently, an on-line 
  scheduling algorithm is proposed corresponding to each problem. The algorithms 
  consist of some mechanisms and techniques that are independent of the system 
  load. However, policies knowledgeable of the load are required to employ the 
  mechanisms effectively. Hence, for reasonable combinations of scheduling 
  problems and contention types, motivated by real-world applications, a number 
  of alternative policies and heuristics are proposed. Finally, the policies are 
  evaluated and compared by means of simulation studies. Briefly, we present and 
  evaluate a set of mechanisms and policies to solve a new class of task 
  scheduling problems, where a task corresponds to the retrieval of a continuous 
  media object in a multi-disk/multi-user environment.

  <DT>Title: Database Challenges in Neuroscientific Applications 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: NeuroImage Journal, Mar. 1997. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: In the scientific community, the quality and progress of various 
  endeavors depend in part on the ability of researchers to share and exchange 
  large quantities of heterogeneous data with one another efficiently. This 
  requires controlled sharing and exchange of information among autonomous, 
  distributed, and heterogeneous databases. In this paper, we focus on a 
  neuroscience application, Neuroanatomical Rat Brain Viewer (NeuART Viewer) to 
  demonstrate alternative database concepts that allow neuroscientists to manage 
  and exchange data. Requirements for the NeuART application, in combination 
  with an underlying network-aware database, are described at a conceptual 
  level. Emphasis is placed on functionality from the user's perspective, and on 
  requirements that the database must fulfill. The most important functionality 
  required by neuroscientists is the ability to construct brain models using 
  information from different repositories. To accomplish such a task, users need 
  to browse remote and local sources and summaries of data, and capture relevant 
  information to be used in building and extending the brain models. Other 
  functionalities are also required, including posing queries related to brain 
  models, augmenting and customizing brain models, and sharing brain models in a 
  collaborative environment. An extensible object-oriented data model is 
  presented to capture the many data types expected in this application. After 
  presenting conceptual level design issues, we describe several known database 
  solutions that support these requirements, and discuss requirements that 
  demand further research. Data integration for heterogeneous databases is 
  discussed in terms of reducing or eliminating semantic heterogeneity when 
  translations are made from one system to another. Performance enhancement 
  mechanisms such as materialized views and spatial indexing for 
  three-dimensional objects are explained and evaluated in the context of 
  browsing, incorporating, and sharing. Policies for providing the system with 
  fault tolerance and avoiding possible intellectual property abuses are 
  presented. Finally, two existing systems are evaluated and compared using the 
  identified requirements.

  <DT>Title: A Redundant Hierarchical Structure for a Distributed Continuous 
  Media Server 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: In IEEE/ACM IDMS'97 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: The growing number of digital audio and video repositories has 
  resulted in a desperate need for effective techniques to deliver data to users 
  in a timely manner. Due to geographical distribution of users, it is not cost 
  effective to have a centralized media server. In this paper, we investigate 
  issues involved in the design of a distributed video server (DVS) to support 
  movie-on-demand (MOD) application. We propose a redundant hierarchical (RedHi) 
  architecture for DVS where the nodes are continuous media servers and the 
  edges are dedicated network lines. With RedHi, each node has two or more 
  parents. We show that the redundant links in RedHi yields a more 
  fault-tolerant and efficient system. Our simulation results demonstrate that 
  RedHi can tolerate a single link failure with no degradation in performance 
  while with pure hierarchy almost 2.5% of requests are rejected due to the 
  failure. In normal mode of operation, RedHi outperforms pure hierarchy 
  significantly (160% improvement on the average when counting the number of 
  rejections). In the context of RedHi, we also propose and evaluate alternative 
  object management policies, resource reservation strategies, and load 
  balancing heuristics.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: ACM Sigmetrics Bulletin, 1997 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: This paper describes a buffer sharing technique that strikes a 
  balance between the use of disk bandwidth and memory in order to maximize the 
  performance of a video-on-demand server. We make the key observation that the 
  configuration parameters of the system should be independent of the physical 
  characteristics of the data (e.g., popularity of a clip). Instead, the 
  configuration parameters are fixed and our strategy adjusts itself dynamically 
  at run-time to support a pattern of access to the video clips.

  <DT>Title: Design and Implementation of Scalable Continuous Media Servers 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: in Parallel Computing, Elsevier, 1998. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: During the past decade, the information technology has evolved 
  to store and retrieve continuous media data types, e.g., audio and video 
  clips. Unlike the traditional data types (e.g., text), continuous media 
  consists of a sequence of quanta, either audio samples or video frames, that 
  convey meaning when presented at a pre-specified rate. A challenging task when 
  implementing these servers is to guarantee retrieval and delivery of a clip at 
  its pre-specified rate. Continuous media servers are expected to play a major 
  role in many application domains including library information systems, 
  entertainment technology, educational applications, etc. The focus of this 
  study is on the disk subsystem of a server and techniques that both enhance 
  its performance and ensure its scalability. By scalable, we mean that the 
  system can grow incrementally as the requirements of an application grows in 
  order to avoid a degradation in performance. This study details data placement 
  techniques across both (1) the zones of a disk in order to trade bandwidth for 
  storage, and (2) multiple disks to enable the system to scale. In addition, we 
  describe scheduling techniques to (1) trade memory for disk bandwidth and vice 
  versa, and (2) merge multiple requests referencing a single clip in order to 
  increase the number of simultaneous displays supported by the system. We 
  present performance results from Mitra, an experimental prototype that 
  realizes an implementation of the presented techniques. These results 
  demonstrate the feasibility of a scalable server.

  <DT>Title: Analysis and Design of Server Informative WWW-sites 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: In Proceedings of CIKM'97 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: The access patterns of the users of a web-site are traditionally 
  analyzed in order to facilitate the user access to the site's information. In 
  this study, however, a systematic approach is introduced in order to analyze 
  the users' navigation paths to the advantage of the web-site owner. Briefly, 
  as users navigate through a web-site, it seems that they are transparently 
  filling a questionnaire designed a priori by the web-site owner. To achieve 
  this, we first cluster the users who navigate $similar$ paths employing the 
  {\em Path Mining} algorithm. Next, the correlation between a set of target 
  questions and the structure of the WWW-site is quantified. This has been done 
  by borrowing the concept of $channel$ from information theory. Finally, we 
  compute the probability of a user's certain answer to each question, given the 
  user's navigation path. The accuracy of the computed probabilities highly 
  depends on the channel parameters. Hence, we describe a learning process based 
  on a set of training data and/or inputs from a human expert, to characterize 
  the channel. We tested our method using a sample WWW-site and the results 
  demonstrate reasonable error rate in predicting the responses to a set of 
  three questions. We also show that the structure of a web-site impacts the 
  accuracy of the predictions. Therefore, we provide a natural measure to 
  compute the effectiveness of a WWW-site structure in answering a target 
  questionnaire. To verify our measure, we applied it on some intuitive design 
  rules and it successfully identified the intuitively $better$ web-site as the 
  winner.

  <DT>Title: Continuous Display Using Heterogeneous Disk-Subsystems 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: ACM Multimedia Conference, Nov. 1997. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: A number of recent technological trends have made data intensive 
  applications such as continuous media (audio and video) servers a reality. 
  These servers store and retrieve a large volume of data using magnetic disks. 
  Servers consisting of heterogeneous disk drives have become a fact of life for 
  several reasons. First, disks are mechanical devices that might fail. The 
  failed disks are almost always replaced with new models. Second, the current 
  technological trend for these devices is one of annual increase in both 
  performance and storage capacity. Older disk models are discontinued because 
  they cannot compete with the newer ones in the commercial arena. With a 
  heterogeneous disk subsystem, the system should support continuous display 
  while managing resources intelligently in order to maximize their utilization. 
  This study describes a taxonomy of techniques that ensure a continuous display 
  of objects using a heterogeneous disk subsystem. This taxonomy consists of: 
  (a) strategies that partition resources into homogeneous groups of disks and 
  manage each independently, and (b) techniques that treat all disks uniformly, 
  termed non-partitioning techniques. We introduce three non-partitioning 
  techniques: disk merging, disk grouping, and staggered grouping. We 
  investigate these techniques using analytical models. Our results demonstrate 
  that disk merging is the most flexible scheme while providing among the lowest 
  cost per simultaneous display. Finally, using an open simulation model, we 
  compare disk merging with a partitioning technique. The obtained results 
  demonstrate the superiority of disk merging.

  <DT>Source: In the 7th Workshop on Information Technologies and Systems (WITS 
  '97) 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Servers that employ scalable techniques prevent the formation of 
  bottlenecks in order to allow the system to support a higher number of clients 
  as function of additional hardware. They are desirable because they enable a 
  growing organization to satisfy the increased demand imposed on its hardware 
  platform by increasing its size (instead of replacing it with a new one which 
  is almost always more expensive~\cite{stone86}). This study presents the 
  design, implementation, and evaluation of scalable techniques in support of 
  video browsing, i.e., VCR functions such as fast-forward and fast-rewind.

  <DT>Abstract: Based on a fifteen month investigation of a post production 
  facilities for both the entertainment industry and broadcasters, we identified 
  a number of challenges that arise when designing a server in support of 
  multiple editing stations. These include, how to: share the same content among 
  multiple editors, support continuous display of the edited content for each 
  editor, support complex editing operations, compute the set of changes 
  (deltas) proposed by an editor and to compare the deltas proposed by multiple 
  editors, etc. It is beyond the focus of this paper to report on each challenge 
  and its related solutions. Instead, we focus on one challenge and the physical 
  design of the system in support of solutions that address this issue.

  <DT>Title: Trading Memory for Disk Bandwidth in Video-on-Demand Servers 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: Proceedings of 13th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, Feb 1998. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: In a Video-on-Demand server, requests from different clients are 
  independent of each other and may arrive at random time. Commercial systems 
  may contain hundreds to thousands of clients and thus providing an individual 
  stream for each client may require very high disk bandwidth in the server. 
  Therefore the disk bandwidth may become a bottleneck resource, restricting the 
  number of concurrent displays in the system. In this paper, we propose a 
  scheme that trades memory for disk bandwidth and strikes a balance in order to 
  prevent either memory or disk bandwidth from becoming a bottleneck resource. 
  Moreover, we obtain the balance point of trading memory for disk bandwidth 
  which leads to the most cost-effective system configuration.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: International Conference on Extending Database Technology 
  (EDBT'98), Mar. 1998. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: A number of recent studies have investigated scheduling 
  techniques in support of variable bit rate (VBR) video. When compared with 
  constant bit rate (CBR) video, VBR has a lower storage and bandwidth 
  requirement while providing the same quality of images. However, a VBR video 
  clip might exhibit a significant variance in the bit rate required to support 
  its continuous display. The previous studies have proposed techniques to 
  support the display of a VBR clip from two different perspectives: disk 
  storage subsystem and the network. In this study, we propose a taxonomy of VBR 
  disk scheduling techniques that includes those proposed for the network. The 
  results demonstrate that a new class of disk scheduling techniques, termed 
  Atomic-VR<SUP>2</SUP> VITAL, is superior. Algorithms used to represent this 
  class were adopted from the networking literature.

  <DT>Title: On Configuring Hierarchical Storage Structures 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: Joint NASA/IEEE Mass Storage Conference, Mar. 98 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: The rapid progress in mass storage technology is enabling 
  designers to implement large databases for a variety of applications. The 
  possible configurations of the hierarchical storage structures (HSS) are 
  numerous and result in various tradeoffs, e.g., storage cost, throughput, 
  initial latency, etc. A naive design might waste system resources and result 
  in high cost. For example, one naive design decision is to add disk caches for 
  those applications whose bandwidth is already satisfied by the tertiary 
  storage device and can tolerate a high latency. In this study, we introduce a 
  configuration planner for HSS in support of video-on-demand applications. The 
  input to the planner are the number of simultaneous displays required by the 
  target application (i.e., throughput), database size, and expected pattern of 
  access to the objects. It's output are the choice of mass storage devices at 
  each level of the hierarchy. The resulting configuration supports the 
  application requirements at a minimum cost per display. It is possible to 
  extend this study to consider other application requirements, such as: initial 
  latency and storage reliability. Moreover, the presented concepts can be 
  generalized to scientific applications.

  Policy which utilizes resources, that are otherwise unused, to improve system 
  performance. Eager Pipelining can be employed when the available bandwidth 
  along the path from a source to a user exceeds the display bandwidth 
  requirement of a referenced continuous media object. In this case, the policy 
  will utilize disk and memory buffers of the intermediate nodes to deliver the 
  object to the user efficiently.

  <DT>Title: Profile Aware Retrieval Optimizer for Continuous Media 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: In the Proceedings of the World Automation Congress (WAC98), 
  Alaska U.S.A., May 98 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: One of the key components of multimedia systems is a Continuous 
  Media (CM) server that guarantees the uninterrupted delivery of continuous 
  media data (i.e., audio and video). Queries imposed by applications, such as 
  customized news-on-demand, might require the retrieval of one or more 
  continuous objects from the CM server. Traditionally, multimedia systems have 
  opted to guarantee that the CM server can display all the objects in the set 
  to the user with no interruptions and with very strict display timing and 
  ordering among the objects. This results in a single possible retrieval plan. 
  However, for a class of applications, we have observed that depending on the 
  user query, user profile, and session profile, there are a number of 
  flexibilities that can be exploited for retrieval optimization, namely: delay, 
  ordering, presentation, and display-quality flexibilities. In this paper, we 
  describe a Profile Aware Retrieval Optimizer (Prime) that utilizes these 
  flexibilities to improve system performance by reducing retrieval contention 
  at the CM server.

  <DT>Title: VARIABLE BIT RATE CONTINUOUS MEDIA SERVERS 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: USC Computer Science Ph.D. Thesis, Aug. 1998. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Continuous media servers are increasingly used to support a 
  number of application domains, e.g., entertainment industry, library 
  information systems, educational applications, etc. Objects of continuous 
  media data type are large in size and their retrieval and display are subject 
  to real-time constraints. Servers are required to accommodate these objects 
  and ensure their continuous display. A number of recent studies have 
  investigated scheduling techniques in support of variable bit rate (VBR) video 
  clips. When compared with constant bit rate (CBR) video, VBR has a lower 
  storage and bandwidth requirement while providing the same image quality. 
  However, a VBR video clip might exhibit a significant variance in the bit rate 
  required to support its continuous display. In this dissertation, we propose 
  VBR disk scheduling techniques that strive to minimize resource requirements 
  (i.e., network bandwidth, disk bandwidth, and buffer size). Moreover, we 
  present a taxonomy of VBR disk scheduling techniques that includes, in 
  addition to our techniques, other techniques found in the literature. This 
  dissertation investigates VCR functions such as fast-forward and fast-rewind 
  viewing functions. These functions typically increase the resource 
  requirements of a continuous media server in terms of storage space, as well 
  as both the network and disk bandwidth. Furthermore, these functions become 
  more challenging because of the additional constraints imposed by compression 
  techniques such as motion pictures experts group (MPEG). In this dissertation, 
  we propose a scalable fast-forward and fast-rewind approach for MPEG encoded 
  video clips. Our approach minimizes resource requirements of a system.

  <DT>Title: DATA SHARING IN INTERACTIVE CONTINUOUS MEDIA SERVERS 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: USC Computer Science Ph.D. Thesis, Aug. 1998. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: In a continuous media server that supports the display of audio 
  or video clips (e.g., a video-on-demand server), requests from different 
  clients are independent of each other and may arrive at random time. 
  Commercial systems may strive to support hundreds, if not thousands of 
  clients. Assigning an individual disk stream for each client may require very 
  high disk bandwidth from a server. This makes the disk bandwidth a bottleneck 
  resource, restricting the number of concurrent displays. One solution is to 
  introduce additional disk drives into the server, however, this might result 
  in a significant system cost that would render the system economically 
  inviable. In this dissertation, we propose novel data sharing techniques to 
  resolve the disk bandwidth bottleneck while making the overall system more 
  cost-effective. We investigate two approaches: buffer sharing and batching. 
  With buffer sharing, if one display of a clip lags another display of the same 
  clip by a short time interval, then the portion between the two is retained in 
  buffers to allow the lagging display to read data from buffers with no disk 
  access. We propose a buffer sharing scheme that strikes a balance in trading 
  memory for disk bandwidth to prevent system bottlenecks (either memory or disk 
  bandwidth). Moreover, this scheme minimizes the system cost to meet a 
  prespecified performance objective. With batching, requests are delayed in the 
  hope of being merged with other requests for the same clip. These merged 
  requests then form a batch and consume only one disk stream. We investigate 
  environments that equip the client with local storage device (e.g ., 
  rewritable DVD) to achieve data sharing among batches and support VCR 
  operations. The local client storage reduces the disk bandwidth requirement at 
  server side dramatically, however, it requires more resource (both disk 
  bandwidth and memory) at client side which may diminish the cost-effectiveness 
  of the environment. When compared with each other, batching with local storage 
  distributes resources into each client, whereas buffer sharing centralizes 
  resources in the server. This dissertation demonstrates that buffer sharing is 
  a more cost-effective solution.

  <DT>Title: Continuous Media Placement and Scheduling in Heterogeneous Disk 
  Storage Systems. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Source: USC Computer Science Ph.D. Thesis, Dec. 1998. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: A number of recent technological trends have made data intensive 
  applications such as continuous media (audio and video) servers a reality. 
  These servers store and retrieve a large volume of data using magnetic disks. 
  Servers consisting of heterogeneous disk drives have become a fact of life for 
  several reasons. First, disks are mechanical devices that might fail. The 
  failed disks are almost always replaced with new models. Second, the current 
  technological trend for these devices is one of annual increase in both 
  performance and storage capacity. Older disk models are discontinued because 
  they cannot compete with the newer ones in the commercial arena. With a 
  heterogeneous disk subsystem, the system should support continuous display 
  while managing resources intelligently in order to maximize their utilization. 
  This dissertation describes a taxonomy of techniques that ensure a continuous 
  display of objects using a heterogeneous disk subsystem. This taxonomy 
  consists of: (a) strategies that partition resources into homogeneous groups 
  of disks and manage each independently, and (b) techniques that treat all 
  disks uniformly, termed non-partitioning techniques. We introduce and evaluate 
  three non-partitioning techniques: Disk Merging, Disk Grouping, and Staggered 
  Grouping. Our results demonstrate that Disk Merging is the most flexible 
  scheme while providing a competitive, low cost per simultaneous display. 
  Finally, using an open simulation model, we compare Disk Merging with a 
  partitioning technique. The obtained results confirm the superiority of Disk 
  Merging.

  <DT>Title: HERA: Heterogeneous Extension of RAID. 
  <DT>Source: Technical report. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: A number of recent technological trends have made data intensive 
  applications such as continuous media (audio and video) servers a reality. 
  These servers store and retrieve a large volume of data using magnetic disks. 
  Servers consisting of multiple nodes and large arrays of heterogeneous disk 
  drives have become a fact of life for several reasons. First, magnetic disks 
  might fail. Failed disks are almost always replaced with newer disk models 
  because the current technological trend for these devices is one of annual 
  increase in both performance and storage capacity. Second, storage 
  requirements are ever increasing, forcing servers to be scaled up 
  progressively. In this study we present HERA, a framework that enables 
  parity-based data protection for heterogeneous storage systems. We describe 
  the tradeoffs associated with three alternative HERA techniques: independent 
  subservers, dependent subservers, and disk merging. The novel disk merging 
  approach provides a low cost solution for systems that require highly 
  available secondary storage.

  <DT>Title: On the Complexity of Coordinated Display of Multimedia Objects. 
  <DT>Source: To appear in Theoretical Computer Science. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: A multimedia presentation can be represented as a collection of 
  objects with temporal constraints that define when the objects are rendered. 
  The display of a presentation is termed coordinated when the display of its 
  objects respects the pre-specified temporal constraints. Otherwise, the 
  display might suffer from failures that translate into meaningless scenarios. 
  For example, a chase scene between a dinosaur and a jeep becomes meaningless 
  if the system fails to render the dinosaur when displaying the scene. A 
  previous study introduced a resource scheduling technique that guarantees a 
  coordinated display of a presentation for single-disk architectures. This 
  technique minimizes both latency and memory requirements and has a worst case 
  time complexity O(nlgn). This paper extends the previousstudy to multi-disk 
  architectures and demonstrates the following: (1) the computation of a 
  resource schedule that supports a coordinated display and yields the minimum 
  latency is NP-Hard, and (2) the computation of the minimum memory requirements 
  to support a coordinated display within a pre-specified latency is NP-Hard.

  <DT>Title: A Comparison of Alternative Continuous Display Techniques with 
  Heterogeneous Multi-Zone Disks. 
  <DT>Source: In Proceedings of CIKM'99. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: A number of recent technological trends have made data intensive 
  applications such as continuous media (audio and video) servers a reality. 
  These servers are expected to play an important role in applications such as 
  video-on-demand, digital library, news-on-demand, distance learning, etc. 
  Continuous media applications are data intensive and might require storage 
  subsystems that consist of hundreds of (multi-zone) disk drives. With the 
  current technological trends, a homogeneous disk subsystem might evolve to 
  consist of a heterogeneous collection of disk drives. Given such a storage 
  subsystem, the system must continue to support a hiccup-free display of audio 
  and video clips. This study describes extensions of four continuous display 
  techniques for multi-zone disk drives to a heterogeneous platform. These 
  techniques include IBM's Logical Track, HP's Track Pairing, and USC's FIXB and 
  dead-line driven techniques. We quantify the performance tradeoff associated 
  with these techniques using analytical models and simulation studies. The 
  obtained results demonstrate tradeoffs between the cost per simultaneous 
  stream supported by a technique, the wasted disk space, and the incurred 
  startup latency.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: This experience paper describes newsblaster.com, a commercial 
  document management system that facilitates exchange of news worthy documents 
  between two user communities: a) editor of newspapers and magazines who seek 
  to publish articles, and b) member companies who want to disseminate 
  information such as new product offerings, product recalls, alliances with 
  other companies, etc. We focus on the Internet connection of a single node web 
  server as the system bottleneck and discuss three alternative approaches to 
  distribute the application across multiple nodes. The first, termed vertical, 
  analyzes the semantics of the application and distributes it across multiple 
  nodes based on its community of users and how they access the system. The 
  second, termed horizontal, declusters the application's data across multiple 
  nodes with the objective to distribute client requests evenly across these 
  nodes. Hybrid, our third approach, considers a horizontal partitioning of 
  services identified by a vertical partitioning. We describe the application of 
  each approach to newsblaster.

  <DT>Title: Alternative Representations and Abstractions for Moving Sensors 
  Databases 
  <DT>Source: In CIKM 2001 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Moving sensors refers to an emerging class of data intensive 
  applications that impacts disciplines such as communication, health-care, 
  scientific applications, etc. These applications consist of a fixed number of 
  sensors that move and produce streams of data as a function of time. They may 
  require the system to match these streams against stored streams to retrieve 
  relevant data (patterns). With communication, for example, a hearing impaired 
  individual might utilize a haptic glove that translates hand signs into 
  written (spoken) words. The glove consists of sensors for different finger 
  joints. These sensors report their location as a function of time, producing 
  streams of data. These streams are matched against a repository of 
  spatio-temporal streams to retrieve the corresponding English character or 
  word. 
  <P>The contributions of this study are two folds. First, it introduces a 
  framework to store and retrieve "moving sensors" data. The framework advocates 
  physical data independence and software-reuse. Second, we investigate 
  alternative representations for storage and retrieval of data in support of 
  query processing. We quantify the tradeoff associated with these alternatives 
  using empirical data from RoboCup soccer matches.

  distributes the objects of the application across the nodes with the objective 
  to evenly distribute system load. As such, it eliminates the need for a system 
  administrator to control the placement of data. We describe the architecture 
  of the middleware that facilitates object migration and its decision making 
  components. One aspect of this architecture is a negotiation protocol to 
  facilitate migration of objects from one node to another. Finally, we describe 
  an implementation of this middleware using Java and Sun's Jini framework.

  <DT>Source: In International Symposium on Intelligent Multimedia, Video and 
  Speech Processing, Hong Kong, May 2001. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: The term multimedia has a different meaning to different 
  communities. The computer industry uses this term to refer to a system that 
  can display audio and video clips. Generally speaking, a multimedia system 
  supports multiple presentation modes to convey information. Humans have five 
  senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste. In theory, a system based on 
  this generalized definition must be able to convey information in support of 
  all senses. This would be a step towards virtual environments that facilitate 
  total recall of an experience. This study builds on our previous work with 
  audio and video servers and explores haptic data in support of touch and motor 
  skills. It investigates the use of clustering techniques to recognize hand 
  signs using haptic data. An application of these results is communication 
  devices for the hearing impaired.

  <DT>Title: Disk Scheduling in Video Editing Systems. 
  <DT>Source: In IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, December 
  2001 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Modern video servers support both video-on-demand and non-linear 
  editing applications. Video-on-demand servers enable the user to videw video 
  clips or movies from a video database, while non-linear editing systems enable 
  the user to manipulate the content of the video database. Applications such as 
  video and news editing systems require that the underlying storage server be 
  able to concurrently record live broadcast information, modify pre-recorded 
  data, and broadcast an authored presentation. A multimedia storage server that 
  efficiently supports such a diverse group of activities constitutes the focus 
  of this study. A novel real-time disk scheduling algorithm that treats both 
  read and write requests in a homogeneous manner in order to ensure their 
  deadlines are met. Due to real-time demands of movie viewing, read requests 
  must be fullfilled within certain deadlines, otherwise they are considered 
  lost. Since the data to be written into disk is stored in main memory buffers, 
  write requests can be postponed until critical read requests are processed. 
  However, write requests still have to be processed within reasonable delays 
  and without the possibility of indefinite postponement. This is due to the 
  physical constraint of the limited size of the main memory write buffers. The 
  new algorithm schedules both read and write requests appropriately, to 
  minimize the amount of disk reads that do not meet their presentation 
  deadlines, and to avoid indefinite postponement and large buffer sizes in the 
  cast of disk writes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed 
  algorithm offers low violations of read deadlines, reduces waiting time for 
  lower priority disk requests, and imporves the throughput of the storage 
  server by enhancing the utilization of available disk bandwidth.

  <DT>Title: A Novel Deadline Driven Disk Scheduling Algorithm for 
  Multi-Priority Multimedia Objects. 
  <DT>Source: In International Conference on Data Engineering, February 2000. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new deadline driven disk 
  scheduling algorithm designed for multimedia servers. The proposed algorithm 
  supports real time requests with multiple priorities, e.g., those for 
  different object classes in digital library applications. The proposed 
  algorithm enhances utilization of disk bandwidth by (a) maintaining one queue 
  for all requests, and (b) optimizing the seek time. Prior schemes, 
  collectively termed "multi-queue schemes", maintain a separate queue for each 
  priority group and optimize the performance of the high prioirty requests 
  only. When compared with our proposed scheme, our technique provides 
  approximately two order of magnitude improvement in meeting the deadline of 
  low priority requests. In addition, this algorithm provides both a better disk 
  utilization and a better average response time. Under certain conditions, our 
  algorithm violates the deadline of a few high priority requests (less than 5 
  out of a million requests).

  Retrieval 
  <DT>Source: In IEEE Transactions on Multimedia 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: This paper describes a novel cost-driven disk scheduling 
  algorithm for environments consisting of multi-priority requests. An example 
  application is a video-on-demand system that provides high and low quality 
  services, termed priority 2 and 1, respectively. Customers ordering a high 
  quality (priority 2) service pay a higher fee and are assigned a higher 
  priority by the underlying system. Our proposed algorithm minimizes costs by 
  maintaining one-queue and managing requests intelligently in order to meet the 
  deadline of as many priority 1 requests as possible while maximizing the 
  number of priority 2 requests that meet their deadline. Our algorithm is 
  general enough to accommodate an arbitrary number of priority levels. Prior 
  schemes, collectively termed ``multi-queue'' schemes maintain a separate queue 
  for each priority level in order to optimize the performance of the high 
  priority requests only. When compared with our proposed scheme, in certain 
  cases, our technique provides more than one order of magnitude improvement in 
  total cost.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: An electronic document may provide more information than its 
  paper-based counter part. For example, in addition to text and images, a 
  scientific document may consist of either the raw data or software that 
  substantiates its hypothesis, ontology of its terms, a detailed comparison 
  with its related work, etc. In this study, we explore: a) an environment that 
  represents a document as a Web Service, and b) two alternative frameworks that 
  facilitate discovery and retrieval of documents, namely, Jini and UDDI. We 
  describe how each framework supports documents that reside on a cluster of 
  nodes. These nodes might be dispersed across the Internet or in geographical 
  proximity using an Intranet setting. In addition to detailing discovery and 
  retrieval of documents, we describe how each framework supports data 
  availability in the presence of load imbalance and node failures. One finding 
  of this study is that these two frameworks are complementary and can be used 
  in conjunction with one another.

  <DT>Title: Performance of Networked XML-Driven Cooperative Applications. 
  <DT>Source: In Proceedings of Second International Workshop on Cooperative 
  Internet Computing (CIC, held in conjunction with VLDB), August 2002. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Web services are an emerging software technology that employ 
  XML, e.g., W3C's SOAP, to share and exchange data. They are a building block 
  of cooperative applications that communicate using a network. They may serve 
  as wrappers for legacy data sources, integrate multiple remote data sources, 
  filter information by processing queries (function shipping), etc. Web 
  services are based on the concept of ``software and data as a service". With 
  those that interact with an end user, a fast response time is the difference 
  between the following two scenarios: (1) users issuing requests, retrieving 
  their results, and visiting the service repeatedly, and (2) users issuing 
  requests, waiting for response and walking away prior to retrieving their 
  results, with a lower likelihood of issuing future requests for this web 
  service. One may employ a middleware to enhance performance by minimizing the 
  impact of transmission time. This is accomplished by compressing messages. 
  This paper identifies factors that this middleware must consider in order to 
  reduce response time. In particular, it must ensure the overhead of 
  compression (increased CPU time) does not exceed its savings (lower 
  transmission time).

  <DT>Title: Device Independence and Extensibility in Gesture Recognition. 
  <DT>Source: In Proceedings of IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (VR), LA, CA, 
  March 2003. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Gesture recognition techniques often suffer from being highly 
  device-dependent and hard to extend. If a system is trained using data from a 
  specific glove input device, that system is typically unusable with any other 
  input device. The set of gestures that a system is trained to recognize is 
  typically not extensible, without retraining the entire system. We propose a 
  novel gesture recognition framework to address these problems. This framework 
  is based on a multi-layered view of gesture recognition. Only the lowest layer 
  is device dependent; it converts raw sensor values produced by the glove to a 
  glove-independent semantic description of the hand. The higher layers of our 
  framework can be reused across gloves, and are easily extensible to include 
  new gestures. We have experimentally evaluated our framework and found that it 
  yields comparable performance to conventional techniques, while substantiating 
  our claims of device independence and extensibility.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Many organizations envision web services as an enabling 
  component of Internet-scale computing. A final vision of web services is to 
  realize a dynamic environment that identifies, composes and executes web 
  services in response to a query. This vision shapes the design and 
  implementation of Proteus. In addition to describing Proteus' novel 
  components, this paper outlines its initial system design.

  <DT>Title: Controlled Buffer Sharing in Continuous Media Servers. 
  <DT>Source: To appear in Kluwer Multimedia Tools and Applications. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Continuous media servers manage delay sensitive data such as 
  audio and video clips. Once a server initiates the display of a clip on behalf 
  of a client, it must deliver the data to the client in a manner that prevents 
  data starvation. Otherwise, its display may suffer from disruptions and 
  delays, termed hiccups. A hiccup-free display is important to a number of 
  applications such as video-on-demand for entertainment, distance learning, 
  news dissemination, etc. Buffer sharing enables a server to trade memory for 
  disk bandwidth to service multiple clients by sharing data in memory, using a 
  single disk stream. However, an uncontrolled buffer sharing scheme may reduce 
  system performance. 
  <P>This paper presents Controlled Buffer Sharing (CBS) as a novel framework 
  that facilitates sharing and supports both a hiccup-free display and VCR 
  operations. It includes a configuration planner and a buffer pool management 
  technique (applied at run time). CBS trades memory for disk bandwidth in order 
  to meet the performance objectives of an application and minimize cost per 
  stream. It uses bridging and merges two displays referencing the same clip 
  when they are $d_t$ blocks apart. One insight of this framework is that $d_t$ 
  is determined by market forces (cost of memory and disk bandwidth) and is 
  independent of a clip's frequency of access. We use both analytical and 
  simulation models to quantify the characteristics of CBS.</P>

  <DT>Title: Highly Available and Heterogeneous Continuous Media Storage 
  Systems. 
  <DT>Source: To appear in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: A number of recent technological trends have made data intensive 
  applications such as continuous media (audio and video) servers a reality. 
  These servers store and retrieve large volumes of data using magnetic disks. 
  Servers consisting of multiple nodes and large arrays of heterogeneous disk 
  drives have become a fact of life for several reasons. First, magnetic disks 
  might fail. Failed disks are almost always replaced with newer disk models 
  because the current technological trend for these devices is one of annual 
  increase in both performance and storage capacity. Second, storage 
  requirements are ever increasing, forcing servers to be scaled up 
  progressively. In this study we present a framework to enable parity-based 
  data protection for heterogeneous storage systems and to compute their mean 
  lifetime. We describe the tradeoffs associated with three alternative 
  techniques: independent subservers, dependent subservers, and disk merging. 
  The disk merging approach provides a solution for systems that require highly 
  available secondary storage in environments that also necessitate maximum 
  flexibility.

  <DT>Web Services are an emerging software technology that employ XML to share 
  and exchange data. They may serve as wrappers for legacy data sources, 
  integrate multiple remote data sources, filter information by processing 
  queries (function shipping), etc. With those that interact with an end user, a 
  fast response time might be the difference between a frustrated and a 
  satisfied user. A Web Service may employ a loss-less compression technique, 
  e.g., Zip, XMill, etc., to reduce the size of an XML message in order to 
  enhance its transmission time. This saving might be outweighed by the overhead 
  of compressing the output of a Web Service at a server and decompressing it at 
  a client. The primary contribution of this paper is NAM, a middleware that 
  strikes a compromise between these two factors in order to enhance response 
  time. NAM decides when to compress data based on the available client and 
  server processor speeds, and network characteristics. When compared with 
  today's common practice to transmit the output of a Web Service uncompressed 
  always, our experimental results show NAM either provides similar or 
  significantly improved response times (at times more than 90% improvement) 
  with Internet connections that offer bandwidths ranging between 80 to 100 
  Mbps.

  determines the number of replicas for a clip i based on (a) the bandwidth 
  required to display clip i proportional to the bandwidth required by the other 
  clips in the database, and (b) the square root of the frequency of access to 
  the clips.

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: This paper describes a Peer-to-Peer Range (PePeR) addressing 
  space to process the ``select" relational algebra operator. We focus on the 
  select operator because it is the most basic and fundamental operator utilized 
  by both simple and complex relational query plans. In addition, with data flow 
  environments, it dictates the performance of other operators by controlling 
  when they are provided with data, impacting the overall performance of a 
  Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system. PePeR consists of several novel design decisions. 
  First, it constructs Z ranges per node in order to efficiently route 
  predicates in a decentralized manner. Second, it employs interleaved range 
  declustering to minimize mean time to data loss in the presence of node 
  removal(s). Third, it uses innovative techniques to adjust its addressing 
  space in the presence of node insertion. The insertion of nodes is done in a 
  distributed manner and we present a technique that approximates a uniform 
  distribution of records across the nodes. In addition, we present performance 
  numbers from PePeR and compare it with a distributed hash table (DHT). The 
  obtained results show the following. If the workload of a relation is 
  dominated by range predicates then PePeR is a superior alternative. On the 
  other hand, if the workload of a relation is primarily exact-match retrievals 
  (selection predicates using the equality comparison operator), then a DHT 
  provides better performance. Both PePeR and DHT may co-exist in a peer-to-peer 
  system simultaneously, enabling a database specialist to employ DHT with one 
  relation and PePeR with another.

  languages, e.g., SQL, indexing techniques for efficient retrieval of data, the 
  concept of a transaction, concurrency control and crash recovery techniques. 
  This paper summarizes our experiences with this course and the challenges of 
  educating students on use of object-oriented concepts and their mapping to

  <DT>Title: Placement of Continuous Media in Wireless Peer-to-Peer Networks. 
  <DT>Source: In IEEE Transaction on Multimedia. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: This study investigates a novel streaming architecture 
  consisting of home-to-home online (H2O) devices that collaborate with one 
  another to provide on-demand access to large repositories of continuous media 
  such as audio and video clips. An H2O device is configured with a high 
  bandwidth wireless communication component, a powerful processor, and 
  gigabytes of storage. A key challenge of this environment is how to place data 
  across H2O devices in order to enhance startup latency, defined as the delay 
  observed from when a user requests a clip to the onset of its display. Our 
  primary contribution is a novel replication technique that enhances startup 
  latency while minimizing the total storage space required from an environment 
  consisting of $\n$ H2O devices. This technique is based on the following 
  intuition: the first few blocks of a clip are required more urgently than its 
  last few blocks and should be replicated more frequently in order to minimize 
  startup latency. We develop analytical models to quantify the number of 
  replicas required for each block. In addition, we describe two alternative 
  distributed implementation of our replication strategy. When compared with 
  full replication, our technique provides on average greater than 97% (i.e. 
  several orders of magnitude) savings in storage space while ensuring zero 
  startup latency and a hiccup-free reception.

  <DT>Abstract: Web Services (WSs) correspond to conceptual entities with well 
  defined interfaces published by different organizations. For example, with 
  businesses, a WS might correspond to a business process to be invoked by other 
  WSs and Internet applications. To increase availability of a WS, an 
  organization might replicate it across different nodes. This study focuses on 
  data intensive applications that (a) expose a conceptual entity as a Web 
  Service (WS) and (b) disperse copies of their WSs across the nodes of a 
  distributed environment to enhance both performance and availability. We 
  describe the design and implementation of a Dependable Web services (DeW) 
  framework to realize physical-location-independence. 
  <P>Physical-location-independence means a plan will execute as long as a copy 
  of its referenced WSs is available. This concept enables the client proxy 
  objects to continue operation in the presence of both failures and WS 
  migrations that balance system load.</P>

  <DT>Title: Evaluation of 802.11a for Streaming Data in Ad-hoc Networks. 
  <DT>Source: In 4th Workshop on Applications and Services in Wireless Networks, 
  Boston, Massachusetts, USA, August 9-11, 2004. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Advances in communication and processing have made ad-hoc 
  networks of wireless devices a reality. One application is home entertainment 
  systems where multiple Home-to-Home (H2O) devices collaborate as peers to 
  stream audio and video clips to a household. In this study, we investigate the 
  feasibility of IEEE 802.11a protocol in combination with both TCP and UDP to 
  realize a H2O device. Challenges include lossy connections, unfair allocation 
  of bandwidth between multiple simultaneous transmissions, and the exposed node 
  limitation. Our primary contribution is an empirical study of 802.11a to 
  quantify these factors and their significance. Our multi-dimensional 
  experimental design consists of the following axes: distance between 
  participating devices, number of intermediate H2O devices used to route a 
  stream from a producing H2O device to a consuming H2O device, and simultaneous 
  number of active streams in the same radio range. Both operating system and 
  application level routing were considered. Obtained results demonstrate the 
  following lessons. First, with a multi-hop UDP transmission, in the absence of 
  congestion control, transient bottlenecks result in a high loss rate. Hence, a 
  transport protocol with congestion control is essential for streaming of 
  continuous media within a H2O cloud. Second, 802.11a does not drop TCP 
  connections in the presence of many competing transmissions (802.11b drops 
  connections). Third, we observed fairness when transmitting several hundred 
  Megabytes (MB) of data, among multiple competing 1-hop TCP and UDP flows. 
  Fourth, while there is unfair allocation of bandwidth with an exposed node, 
  the observed bandwidths are sufficient to stream a high-quality video clip 
  (with a 4 Mbps display bandwidth requirement). These results indicate 
  streaming of data is feasible with an ad-hoc network of wireless devices 
  employing the 802.11a protocol.

  <DT>Title: Near Optimal Number of Replicas for Continuous Media in Ad-hoc 
  Networks of Wireless Devices, International Workshop on Multimedia Information 
  Systems, Washington D.C., August 25-27, 2004. 
  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: This study investigates replication of data in a novel streaming 
  architecture consisting of ad-hoc networks of wireless devices. One 
  application of these devices is home-to-home (H2O) entertainment systems where 
  a device collaborates with others to provide each household with on-demand 
  access to a large selection of audio and video clips. These devices are 
  configured with a substantial amount of storage and may cache several clips 
  for future use. A contribution of this study is a technique to compute the 
  number of replicas for a clip based on the square-root of the product of 
  bandwidth required to display clips $(\beta _i)$ and their frequency of access 
  $(f_i)$, i.e., $(\beta_i\times f_i)^\alpha$ where $\alpha=0.5$. We provide a 
  proof to show this strategy is near optimal when the objective is to maximize 
  the number of simultaneous displays in the system with string and grid (both 
  symmetric and asymmetric) topologies. We say ``near optimal" because values of 
  $\alpha$ less than 0.5 may be more optimum. In addition, we use analytical and 
  simulation studies to demonstrate its superiority when compared with other 
  alternatives. A second contribution is an analytical model to estimate the 
  theoretical upper bound on the number of simultaneous displays supported by an 
  arbitrary grid topology of H2O devices. This analytical model is useful during 
  capacity planning because it estimates the capabilities of a H2O configuration 
  by considering: the size of an underlying repository, the number of nodes in a 
  H2O cloud, the representative grid topology for this cloud, and the expected 
  available network bandwidth and storage capacity of each device. It shows that 
  one may control the ratio of repository size to the storage capacity of 
  participating nodes in order to enhance system performance. We validate this 
  analytical model with a simulation study and quantify its tradeoffs.

  <DT>Source: In Proceedings of the International Conference on Distributed

  <P></P>
  <DT>Abstract: Self-organizing ad hoc networks of wireless devices such as 
  Car-to-Car Peer-to-Peer Networks (C2P2) are an emerging technology. 
  Entertainment applications that manipulate continuous media, audio and video 
  clips, push the limits of these networks due to their stringent requirements. 
  These challenges are magnified by environmental characteristics such as 
  dynamic wireless network connections, mobility, multi-hop nature of the 
  network and the possible lack of a fixed infrastructure. In these networks, an 
  intelligent admission control policy enhances Quality of Service (QoS) 
  observed by the users of the system. This paper makes the case for a 
  decentralized Mobility based ADmission Control (MAD) policy. We develop QoS 
  utility models to quantify the performance of this policy with an environment 
  that employs no-admission control. Obtained results show conclusively that MAD 
  provides orders of magnitude improvement when compared with no admission 
  control.

  <DT>Abstract: Web Services (WSs) are emerging as the building block of

  intelligently execute plans that reference autonomous WSs. This requires 
  policies and mechanisms for both scheduling and allocating WSs that constitute 
  a plan. In this study, we analyze two scheduling strategies and four 
  allocation policies. Obtained results that a dynamic scheduling with Lest 
  Response Time (LRT) allocation policy is superior to other alternatives when 
  the service time of a WS can be estimated accurately. The Least Recently Used 
  (LRU) allocation policy is inferior to all other policies including Random.

  <DT>Abstract: Display of continuous media using self-organizing ad hoc 
  networks of wireless communication systems will potentially be used in a

  missions, conferences, and university campuses to name a few. Challenges of 
  these environments include their mobility, and unpredictable network bandwidth 
  and loss characteristics. This paper explores a three step science of design 
  for applications that manipulate continuous media. This science strives to 
  satisfy the requirements of an application. It consists of a number of 
  principles that impact the design of algorithms. These principles guide a 
  system designer towards parameterized algorithms that treat network bandwidth 
  and storage as one.

  <DT>Abstract: Advances in wireless communication, storage and processing are 
  realizing next-generation in-vehicle entertainment systems. Even if hundreds 
  of different video or audio titles are stored among several vehicles in an 
  area, only a subset of these titles might be available to a given vehicle 
  depending on its current location, intended path, and the dynamics of its 
  ad-hoc network connectivity. The vehicle's entertainment system must somehow 
  predictively determine which titles are \emph{available} either immediately or 
  within the future $\delta$ time units, so that the user can select a title to 
  view. The available title list must seek to satisfy the user by striking a 
  delicate balance between showing far fewer titles than can actually be 
  accessed and showing too many titles that cannot be accessed. In addition to 
  defining this availability problem, we make two key contributions. First, a 
  two-tier system architecture which leverages the low-rate cellular 
  infrastructure to exchange control messages and facilitate delivery of large 
  data transfers using the ad-hoc network of vehicular devices. Second, PAVAN as 
  a policy framework for predicting the availability of a title. We describe 
  several variants of PAVAN which incorporate information based on a Markov 
  mobility model, spatio-temporal look-ahead, and title replications. Our 
  results demonstrate that the quality of PAVAN's predictions is critically 
  dependent on degree of title replication, as well as its display time relative 
  to the trip duration. When degree of replication is below a certain threshold, 
  PAVAN with content density information and the predictive mobility model is 
  shown to provide the best overall performance.

  <DT>Title: Delivery of Continuous Media in Ad-Hoc Networks of Wireless Devices. 
  <DT>Source: Distinguished Lecturer Series, Wright State University, December 8, 2004.

  <DT>Abstract: Ad-hoc networks of wireless devices are essential to many civilian
    and military applications. An example civilian application is the
    "last-mile" challenge to deliver multimedia services, e.g.,
    games/audio/video-on-demand, to households.
    This talk starts with the challenges of managing data
    and resources in an ad-hoc network of devices.
    It focuses on placement of data across devices and presents
    three alternative replication strategies:
    Simple, Halo-Block, and Halo-Clip.
    It concludes by summarizing the tradeoffs associated with these
    techniques, demonstrating a spectrum of placement strategies
    with Simple and Halo-Block at its two extreme ends.
